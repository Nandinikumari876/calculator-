# calculator-
A simple calculator program that perform basic arithmetic operations like addition,subtraction,multiplication,and divison
This project is a Python-based Calculator developed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
For security purposes, an OTP (One Time Password) system is implemented using Python’s built-in random library.
The calculator allows access only after successful OTP verification, which helps in understanding random number generation, conditional statements, and basic program flow in Python.
This project is suitable for beginners who want to practice Python programming concepts in a simple and practical way.
